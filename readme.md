Gnoga 2d drawing example

Based on tutorial (in french) by Pascal Pignard:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is more from my efforts to produce an english language verion of the
excellent Gnoga tutorial that has been so helpful to me getting Gnoga up and
running. This portion covers Gnoga's 2d drawing canvas. Gnoga's 2d drawing is a
thick cairo binding that should be somewhat familiar for those familiar with the
cairo drawing library. I can't say that I am. The Gnoga application draws and
send these vector images to the browser and an impressive rate which should be
more than enough for most applications.

I can think of a lot of neat things that could be done with it. Procedural
vector drawing is a whole art that one would have to learn to really take
advantage of it all. I dont think I'll have time to really master drawing, but I
hope to do enough with it to be able to implement some of my own GUI widgets for
a few ideas I've been thinking about lately. This example draws some lines, text
and an arc.

I'll probably consolodate all this tutorial material into a single repo once I
have it all working, then it will be time to think about posting it somewhere.
